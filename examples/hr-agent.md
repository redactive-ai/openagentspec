# Example - HR Agent

Consider an agent that answers questions about the internal processes of BusyCorpâ€™s Human Resources department. To ensure relevancy of the information retrieved by the agent to answer the questions, we place restrictions on its use of tools:


```yaml
kind: "openagentspec:v1/agent"
name: hr-agent
description: An agent that can answer HR related questions
intent: You are an agent that answers questions for the Human Resources department of BusyCorp.
owner: Matthew Timms

capabilities:
    "search-knowledge-base":
        input_restriction:
            assertion: recent.search-knowledge-base.inputs["knowledge_base_id"].startsWith("Busycorp/HR/")
```
