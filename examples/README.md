# Examples

Here is a collection of example agents. These are a work in progress as we iterate the spec itself, but hopefully help frame what is possible.

* [Web Browser](web-browser.md): A simple Agent that is configured to browse the internet without authentication
* [Meeting Scheduler](meeting-scheduler.md): An agent that schedules meetings between you and others
* [HR Agent](hr-agent.md): An agent that can *only* access information relating to HR
* [Multi-Agent (Internal)](multi-agent-internal.md): An agent that utilises other Agents within the same server
* [Multi-Agent (External)](multi-agent-external.md): An agent that utilises another Agent from a different server

These examples don't contain tool implementations, but we are working on implementing example tools in [Agent OS](https://github.com/redactive-ai/agent-os). Feel free to open a PR to get involved!

More examples to come:
* Restricting a Tool that doesn't support user identities
