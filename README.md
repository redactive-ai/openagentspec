# Open Agent Spec

At Redactive, we have extensive experience in developing, deploying, and maintaining generative AI applications. In this RFC, we define what a Generative AI Agent, or “Agent” is, how they can be defined safely and securely, and outline a formal standard to provide consistent expectations for agentic workflows. Agents that follow the OpenAgentSpec are able to:
* Be used by multiple authorized users (multi-tenant agents)
* Interact with highly sensitive content (secure agents)
* Autonomously perform actions safely (safe agents)
* Communicate with other agents:
  * with differing authorization boundaries
  * across organisational boundaries

By taking an opinionated stance on what an Agent is, we aim to further our goals to:
* Assist consumers and enterprises to onboard agents securely
* Establish best practises for platform providers to integrate with
* Build consistent expectations of how an agent should operate

We aim to maintain this specification in an open fashion, including hosting requests for comments amongst industry leaders, and ensuring all future changes are versioned semantically as ideas evolve.
